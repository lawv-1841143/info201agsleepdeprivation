## 1.0 Introduction
### 1.1 Problem situation

The sleeping trend in the U.S. in recent years has not demonstrated positive changes, especially for adults and some teenagers. They have less sleeping time and poor sleeping quality. According to Envisioning Cards, direct stakeholders are students, workers, and sleep Apps designers. On the other hand, Indirect stakeholders covers a wide range of people in the society, from ear-plug and bedding manufacturers to pedestrians passing the crossroads. Currently, there is no policy designed to protect and solve the problem for people who suffer from sleep deprivation. Some possible causes for sleep deprivation include: (1) schoolwork overload and  (2) meaningless overtime work, which has no policy to protect human rights and only count towards ethnic questions of not squeezing people’s productive values. Our team cares about this situation so much because people tend to take not enough sleep for granted without realizing the potential damage it does to our body. Some people may find it harmless for now because they still have a strong and healthy body, but eventually, it will be too late if bad things happen. The purpose of the project is simply to bring people’s attention and call on them to make changes.

### 1.2 What is the problem?

The sleeping trend in the U.S. in recent years is not going well, especially for adults and some teenagers. They have lesser sleeping time and lower sleeping quality. According to the Envisioning Cards, direct stakeholders can be students, workers, and sleep Apps, designers. Indirect stakeholders can be almost every person in many malicious influences that are generated by sleep deprivation. People's productivity levels will decline and, more severely, they will face the stagnation of social development. It is also possible to increase the risk of illness and cause negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. Right now, the general issue is “if people do not have enough sleep and are suffering from it, what are the causes and how can we get better for it?” The National Alliance on Mental Illness states that up to 44 percent of college students have reported themselves experiencing symptoms of depression, and 50 percent have suffered from anxiety, due to sleep deprivation caused by the overwhelming workload at college (“Mental Health Guide,” 2019).

### 1.3 What does it matter?

The problem of sleep deprivation matters because it influences physical and mental health, as well as their work and their relationships with others. Studies show that sleep deprivation in the long run impacts necessary skills that an adult needs to perform well such as memory recall or concentration, resulting in poor performance when working or doing assignments for school . Moreover, because of sleep deprivation impacts on their cognition, these students’ GPA do not correctly illustrate their understanding of the classes, making grading system less reliable to assess students’ understanding and knowledge-applying of the class. In addition, sleep deprivation can also contribute to mental disorders, such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety (Cunningham, 2019).

### 1.4 How it will be addressed?

Four aspects are being addressed to display this issue. The current trend will be shown in a line graph. And facts will be collected and shown to people, saying that bad things that cause physical and mental harm to people is happening just because of the lack of sleep, such as the number of cases of fatigue driving, anxiety, and prolonged reaction time. A bar graph will simply show the number of cases. Then it’s time to discuss the cause that is leading to this trend. By following a dataset in a life tracking app, a pie chart will display what are people doing for 24 hours a day. Finally, the users’ attention needs to be drawn by listing possible diseases that people might have due to sleep deprivation. A grouped bar graph is the best way to show contrast and changes with and without enough sleep.

The audience of our project would mostly be college students and people who just started to work. Potentially, everyone who is lack of sleep should be drawn to this topic and, ideally, impressed by it. 

## 2.0 Research Questions
* What is the current trend of sleep deprivation among adults?
* What are the major causes leading to this trend in U.S.?
* How does sleep deprivation in the U.S affect people’s daily performances? 
* What are some potential health risks for not enough sleep?

## Appendix 2: Reflections 

### Yu-Wen Chen: 

Working on this project, I now have a better understanding on how shiny, ggplot2, and dplyr function in R. At first, just by looking at the shiny app website people made from previous quarter, I was a little intimidated by how much work, research, and coding we have to do to create an interactive website with rich information and plots. However, as I worked through all the process with my team, I realized that building a website is pretty much like building a house. It seems hard and impossible, but if we just be patient and enjoy the process of “building”(which includes researching, coding, communicating with team members, overcoming difficulties) little by little, we will be surprised by how much we have done and how much we can do. However, although working with my team and building the project are interesting, it could be frustrating sometimes. I have struggled with finding relevant dataset and doing data wrangling, but the moment I got it right was so satisfying and I felt a sense of accomplishment. 

### Hanzhi Cao: 

It’s really exciting to work with shiny and see what it can do. Learning new tools can always fascinate me, but on the other hand, it took a long time for me to get familiar with the syntax. As for finding real-life dataset, I found it really hard to find a usable dataset that fits our expectations. Even if we find a dataset, how to reformat the dataset into a way that is clear to see and to plot is extremely hard. Because it’s real-life data, it’s like finding valuable piece from a big file of old newspapers, both time consuming and technically challenging. In the future, I’ll definitely give myself more time to do the project, because this time we started kind of late. My coding skills definitely improved. Logical thinking is also needed for this project to generate new research questions and be critical for the dataset that we are using. As for the identity for innovator, I tried to find an interesting way to build the shiny app and make it more interactive. In general, it’s been a good learning experience. 

### Phuong Vu: 

From this project, I learned a lot of new interesting applications and syntaxes in R, including data wrangling , the Shiny app, ggplot2, plot_ly and interaction on Github’s repository. Other than the technical knowledge, I also learned to collect data, turn it into a visualization and analyze it to support my point. The most satisfying thing about this project is able to execute your code right away and see what does it look like on real website thanks to the Shiny app. The frustration of working on this project is finding the datasets. It is hard to find suitable datasets for our specific project topic, even when we found one, it requires multiple data wrangling steps to create another data frame that can serve for our visualization. In the future, I would try to look for more styling syntax to make our website look cooler, as well as contacting with my partners sooner and more regularly to ensure equal contribution to the project. This project definitely help me improve my coding skills in R and give me experience creating interactive web for my other projects in the future. As a thinker, this project helps me think critically about a topic through its data and visualization. As an 2innovator, this project keeps me finding better and more creative ways to improve my code and performances . In general, working on this project is a pleasant experience.

## Appendix 3: Use of Envisioning Cards

For this project, our team uses envisioning cards to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our work. Each envisioning card helps us to think from a different perspective and allows us to create an educational project that benefits not only college students but also the general public. Furthermore, envisioning cards is useful while structuring our project. For example, Direct Stakeholders and Indirect Stakeholder cards were used to generate the problem situation. Long-Term Health and Well-Being card guides us to think about how our project can encourage and raise people’s awareness of the issue of sleep deprivation, and it also highlights the importance of getting enough sleep. These all contribute to our goal to create a healthier society.
